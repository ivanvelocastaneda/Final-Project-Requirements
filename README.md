# Final Project Information

# What is it?
This is a video game store where users can buy videogames at discounted prices. It includes a home page, a register and log in page, a profile page, a cart page, and a page for each console ( Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo Switch and PC). 

# Purpose and Audience
The purpose of this website is to give an opportunity to games who do not have the resources to buy brand new games and the intended audience would be the video game community or simplay people who are passionate and enjoy playing video games. 

# What does it consist of?
Users are able to create an account, log in to their account, shop for videogames, and add them to their cart. They can also access their account information, and eventually make their purchase. I wanted to implement a search page where user could look for a certain video game but I ran out of time. However, it is something I plan on doing in the near future. 

# Issues with the site
The cart page, and show more option are not fully implemented and do not work properly. They do not display the desired results and it is something I plan on solving in the near future. The cart page does not display the game's information and that is also the case with the show more option which would've taken the user to a page that displays a specific's game information and similar items. 

Cart Page
